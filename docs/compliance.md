# LegacyChain GDPR Compliance Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines LegacyChain's approach to GDPR compliance, data privacy, and security measures implemented within our voice-first memory vault platform.

## Data Retention Policy

| Data Type | Retention Period | Justification |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|
| User Account Information | 24 months after last login | Necessary for account maintenance |
| Voice Recordings | Until explicitly deleted by user or vault owner | Core application functionality |
| Access Logs | 90 days | Security and audit requirements |
| Authentication Tokens | 7 days maximum | Security best practice |
| Inactive Accounts | 12 months, then anonymized | Balance between user experience and data minimization |

## Data Subject Rights Implementation

### Technical Implementation

1. **Right to Access (Article 15)**
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/user/data-export`
   - Format: JSON data export with linked media files
   - Authentication: Requires email confirmation

2. **Right to Rectification (Article 16)**
   - User profile edit functionality
   - Direct edit of memory metadata

3. **Right to Erasure (Article 17)**
   - Endpoint: `DELETE /api/v1/user/account`
   - 30-day soft deletion period before permanent removal
   - Cascading deletion of all user-generated content

4. **Right to Restriction (Article 18)**
   - Account deactivation option
   - Granular privacy controls per memory

5. **Right to Data Portability (Article 20)**
   - Structured data export in standard formats (.json, .mp3)
   - Includes all user-generated content

### Automated Processes

- Monthly audit of PII fields
- Quarterly review of retention periods
- Automated handling of data subject requests

## Consent Management

1. **Explicit Consent Collection**
   - Tiered consent UI during onboarding
   - Purpose-specific consent options
   - Clear language about data usage

2. **Consent Withdrawal**
   - One-click withdrawal option
   - Immediate processing of withdrawal

3. **Consent Records**
   - Immutable audit trail of consent
   - Timestamped records of all consent changes

## Data Security Measures

1. **Encryption**
   - Data at rest: AES-256
   - Data in transit: TLS 1.3
   - Database-level field encryption for PII

2. **Access Controls**
   - Role-based access (Member vs Owner)
   - IP-based login anomaly detection
   - Principle of least privilege

3. **Security Monitoring**
   - Automated vulnerability scanning
   - Regular penetration testing
   - Security incident response plan

## Implementation Roadmap

| Phase | Completion Date | Key Deliverables |
|-------|----------------|------------------|
| 1. PII Audit | Q2 2025 | Complete inventory of all PII fields |
| 2. API Endpoints | Q2 2025 | Implementation of all data subject rights endpoints |
| 3. Automated Compliance | Q3 2025 | Tooling for compliance verification |
| 4. External Audit | Q4 2025 | Third-party compliance verification |
